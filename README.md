## Introduction
This project is a React Native app designed to monitor and analyze Twitter trends and hashtags efficiently on Android devices. The app fetches trends, categorizes them, and retrieves relevant tweets for analysis. Before installing, please download and set up your Android Studio and Expo Go for best performance.

## Setup and Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm/yarn.
2. Set up React Native development environment.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
5. Obtain Twitter API credentials and update them in the app.
6. Launch the app using Expo CLI.

## Implementation Details

### Framework and Platform Choice
The app is built using React Native and Expo for cross-platform compatibility and ease of development.

### Trend and Hashtag Identification
Trends and hashtags are fetched from the Twitter API using the `expo-twitter` package.

### Category Implementation
Trends and hashtags are categorized into predefined groups (e.g., Entertainment, Fashion) based on keywords associated with each category.

### Content Fetching
Relevant tweets for selected trends or hashtags are fetched from the Twitter API using the `react-native-twitter` package.
``` const fetchTrends = async () => {
    const client = new TwitterAPI({
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
      accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      accessTokenSecret: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET',
    });
```
Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_API_SECRET', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN', and 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET' with your actual Twitter API credentials from X Developer Portal.
## Usage Instructions
To use the app:

1. Launch the app on your device or simulator.
2. Select categories to view trends and hashtags.
3. Click on a trend/hashtag to fetch related tweets.
4. Scroll through fetched tweets for analysis.

## Future Considerations
Future improvements and additional features may include:
- Enhanced user interface and experience.
- Advanced sentiment analysis of fetched tweets.
- User authentication and personalization features.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a React Native app for Twitter trends and content fetching. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
